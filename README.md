# Che2410_Project1

In this project, the aim is to determine whether there is a relationship between the number of covid deaths and the age and education level of the population in the counties in Florida. A correlation may exist as people with higher levels of education may be more adherent to vaccination and COVID protocols while also having more freedom to work remotely with the exceptions of higher educated frontline workers. Further, the older the individual, the more susceptible they may be to COVID infection and death and perhaps the less likely they are to be receptive to COVID mitigating protocols. So counties with older populations may have higher deaths.
