Title:Trends in COVID-19 deaths with age and educational attainment in counties in Florida 

Introduction

There have been a number of trends observed bewteen demographic data such as age, race and the number of COVID-19 deaths. It has been well established that there is a direct relationship between age and the number of deaths. The older the individual, the more susceptible they may be to COVID infection and death and perhaps the less likely they are to be receptive to COVID mitigating protocols.Infection and death rates may also depend on risk of exposure and vaccination. Remote work was intended to reduce an individual's exposure to COVID-19, however, remote work may not have been possible for everyone in the different labor sectors, especially in occupations deemed 'low-skill'. It is thought that people with higher levels of education may have had more freedom to work remotely, with the exception of higher educated frontline workers, which would reduce their risk of exposure. They may also be more adherent to vaccination and COVID protocols. Given this information, it is predicted that areas with older populations and lower educaation levels would have higher deaths. Therefore, in this project, the aim is to determine whether there is a relationship between the number of covid deaths and the age and education level of the population in the counties in Florida.
