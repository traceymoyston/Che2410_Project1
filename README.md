Title:Trends in COVID-19 deaths with age and educational attainment in counties in Florida 

Introduction

There have been a number of trends observed bewteen demographic data such as age, race and the number of COVID-19 deaths. It has been well established that there is a direct relationship between age and the number of deaths. The older the individual, the more susceptible they may be to COVID infection and death and perhaps the less likely they are to be receptive to COVID mitigating protocols.Infection and death rates may also depend on risk of exposure and vaccination. Remote work was intended to reduce an individual's exposure to COVID-19, however, remote work may not have been possible for everyone in the different labor sectors, especially in occupations deemed 'low-skill'. It is thought that people with higher levels of education may have had more freedom to work remotely, with the exception of higher educated frontline workers, which would reduce their risk of exposure. They may also be more adherent to vaccination and COVID protocols. Given this information, it is predicted that areas with older populations and lower educaation levels would have higher deaths. Therefore, in this project, the aim is to determine whether there is a relationship between the number of covid deaths and the age and education level of the population in the counties in Florida. 

Methodology 

  Data collection 
  The cumulative COVID-19 deaths for counties in Florida for 2022 were obtained from NY Times. Florida county age for 2019 and educational attainment for 2020 were both obtained from the United States Census Bureau. 
  
From the data collected, the counties with the highest and lowest deaths were obtained. The education level for the population age 25 and older and the county population age were compared by U test to determine whether there was a difference between the two counties with regard to educational level and population age. 
It was assumed that the education data and age data for the general population do not follow normal distributions. This is supported by the plot of education level for Florida (Figure 1) and age distributions for the US (not shown).

The education level and population age were compared as fractions of the total county population to allow for a more accurate comparison. 

The relationship between the population age, educational attainment and COVID deaths in Florida was determined using linear regressions and accounting for interaction effects. The median age for each county and percent of the county population with a Bacelor's degree or higher were used to determine this relationship. Here, counties with older populations were defined as having a median age>50. This age was chosen based on COVID death data showing that people age 50+ were more likely to die of COVID than those younger. Percents greater than 30.5% for percent of county population with a Bachelor's degree or higher were deemed as having higher level of education since these percentages would be above the average percentage for the entire state of Florida.
